Major thanks to grandseiken for creating the Factorio mod "Ultracube" - it is licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0 (The same license this project is licensed under), and having a big mod to dissect helped me learn factotio modding a lot faster. Under GNU General Public License v3.0, I also am able to make use of project individual parts, of which I made use, by using the sand icon from his mod. 
It is also important to mention the Factorio developers and wiki maintainers. Without them, this beatiful game would not exist, or at the very least, I wouldn't be able to create this mod.
